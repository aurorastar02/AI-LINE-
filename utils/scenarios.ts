  // 實驗室日常與失敗
  "炸了! (Shock): Holding a test tube that explodes violently with purple smoke. Face is hilariously distorted, eyes popping out cartoonishly.",
  "怪東西 (Weird): Stirring a bubbling green sludge in a beaker. A weird alien tentacle emerges from the sludge. Looking disgusted and terrified.",
  "焦了 (Burnt out): After an electric shock. Fur is standing straight up, covered in soot, smoke coming out of ears. Blank, stunned expression.",
  "融化 (Melting): Literally melting into a puddle of orange goo on the lab floor, only eyes remain. Caption 'I'm done'.",
  "卡住 (Stuck): Head stuck inside a large glass flask. Muffled, panicked expression.",
  "嘿嘿 (Mad Scientist): Laughing maniacally while holding two glowing potions, glasses reflecting chaotic light. Drool coming out of mouth.",
  "崩潰 (Frustrated): Scribbling furiously on a clipboard, then slamming it on the ground. Chalk dust everywhere.",
  
  // 抽象與身體變形
  "昇華 (Soul leaving): Standing still while a translucent, ghostly version of itself floats out of its mouth.",
  "位移 (Derpy): Face rearranged cubism style. One eye is on the cheek, mouth is on the forehead. Looking very confused.",
  "拉長 (Stretched): Body is impossibly stretched out long like a noodle across the lab table.",
  "幾何 (Geometric): Turned into a pile of abstract geometric shapes (cubes and spheres) with its original patterns.",
  "爆載 (Overload): Top of the head opens up like a lid, smoke and gears pop out. Eyes swirling.",
  "驚呆 (Jaw Drop): Jaw drops all the way to the floor, tongue rolls out like a red carpet. Eyes bulging enormously.",
  
  // 搞怪社交互動
  "可以吧 (Doubtful OK): Giving an OK hand sign, but the hand is shaking uncontrollably, and sweat drops are flying.",
  "閃亮登場 (Hi/Appearance): Emerging dramatically from a cloud of pink explosion smoke, waving awkwardly.",
  "沒人 (Hiding/No): Only its butt and tail are sticking out from under a lab table. Trembling.",
  "救命 (Help): Being chased by a giant mutated bouncy ball with teeth. Running desperately.",
  "觀察中 (Staring): Looking through a giant magnifying glass, the eye is magnified 10 times larger, looking intensely weird."
